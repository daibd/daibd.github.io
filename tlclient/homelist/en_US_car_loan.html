                        Compared to home loans, Car loans are personalshort-term loans, so product policies are more
                        flexible, but interest rates aregenerally higher than mortgage rates. In terms of the
                        classification of lendinginstitutions, there are car loans from Car dealer, from bank and
                        fromprofessional institution in the market. These three methods have differentemphasis on
                        different customer needs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        1. Although the car loan from car dealer willintroduce some interest rate promotions, the
                        limitations of such products arestrong, and generally only serve the car dealership. The
                        promotion will alsoaffect the bargain space of the car price; it is not applicable to
                        allcustomers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. The interest rate of car loans from major bank istoo high (the general interest rate is
                        between 6% and 10%, while some largebanks are as high as 14.99%.) The loan materials are
                        cumbersome, and theapproval time is long and the requirements are strict.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. professional financial institutions loans arecurrently more common car loan channels, but the
                        low interest rates in thepublicity are mostly not reliable.
